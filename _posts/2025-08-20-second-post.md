Welcome to my new post!

As you can see, I am just writing text. Jekyll handles everything else.

## Main Section Title
This heading will automatically appear in the sidebar's Table of Contents.

### A smaller subsection
This one will appear too, and it will be indented.

It's that simple. You never have to touch the complex HTML structure again unless you want to change the design for ALL your posts at once.
